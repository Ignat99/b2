# Install on Windows

Requires a fast PC running Windows 7 or better.

Files for the latest release are here:
https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases/latest.

Download the `b2-windows-XXX.zip` file. (You don't need to download
any of the other files; this file contains everything required.)

Unzip to a folder of your choice and run `b2.exe`.

## Windows 7 performance

If you have trouble with slow startup and poor performance on Windows
7, try running `b2.exe` from the command line with the `--timer`
option: `b2 --timer`.

This setting is sticky, and will be saved on exit for future runs. So
after you've done this once, you can just run it from Windows Explorer
in future.
