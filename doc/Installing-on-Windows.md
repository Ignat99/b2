# Install on Windows

Requires a fast PC running Windows 7 or better.

Get a binary .zip release from the
[b2 GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases).
Get the latest one with files attached - probably the one at the top!

Unzip to a folder of your choice and run `b2.exe`.

## Windows 7 performance

If you have trouble with slow startup and poor performance on Windows
7, try running `b2.exe` from the command line with the `--timer`
option: `b2 --timer`.

This setting is sticky, and will be saved on exit for future runs. So
after you've done this once, you can just run it from Windows Explorer
in future.
