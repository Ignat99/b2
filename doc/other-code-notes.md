# Submodule remotes

GitHub mostly tracks the right forks. Find the `tom-seddon` copy of
the submodule and use the URL of the forked repo as the `upstream`
remote.

## `imgui`

This was originally a fork of the upstream repo, but it now tracks
somebody else's fork, which is where the docking UI stuff comes from:

    git remote add Flix01 ssh://git@github.com/Flix01/imgui
