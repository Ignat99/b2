# Install on macOS

Requires a 64-bit machine running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later.

Get a binary .dmg release from the
[b2 GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases).
Get the latest one with files attached - probably the one at the top!

Open the dmg, drag b2 to your Applications folder, and run it from
there.

## Keystroke Receiving warning

The first time you run b2 on newer macOS, you may get a warning about
b2 wanting to receive keystrokes from any application. (This is due to
b2's tracking of the Caps Lock key... it isn't trying to steal your
data!)

Granting it access is optional, though necessary for the Caps Lock key
to work in the emulator. Follow the prompts if you want to do this.

If you'd prefer to deny it access, the Mac's Caps Lock key will simply
do nothing in b2. The default keyboard settings treat the Page Up key
as Caps Lock, so you won't lose out in this case.
