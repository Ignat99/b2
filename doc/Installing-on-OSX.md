# Install on OS X

Requires a 64-bit machine running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later.

Get a binary .dmg release from the
[b2 GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases).
Get the latest one with files attached - probably the one at the top!

Open the dmg, drag b2 to your Applications folder, and run it from
there.
