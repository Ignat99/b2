# Install on OS X

Requires a 64-bit machine running OS X 10.13 or later.

Get a binary .dmg release from the
[b2 GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases).
Get the latest one with files attached - probably the one at the top!

Open the dmg, drag b2 to your Applications folder, and run it from
there.

## Older OS X versions

Release
[`b2-20190804-012555-9198f33`](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/releases/tag/b2-20190804-012555-9198f33)
and earlier should run on OS X 10.7+.

Apple don't seem to make it easy to build for older versions of OS X.
