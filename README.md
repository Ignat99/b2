# b2

A cross-platform BBC Micro emulator. Use your Windows/Linux PC or
macOS computer to play your old BBC games or develop new BBC software.

If you have feedback, please add it to the
[b2 GitHub issues page](https://github.com/tom-seddon/b2/issues).

For installation on Windows or OS X, see the
[Windows installation instructions](./doc/Installing-on-Windows.md) or
[OS X installation instructions](./doc/Installing-on-OSX.md); to
install on Linux, follow the
[building instructions](./doc/Building.md).

There's a summary of the functionality available in
[the overview](./doc/Overview.md).

You can configure how the emulator starts up using the
[command line options](./doc/Command-Line.md).

For creating or hacking BBC software, the
[debug version](./doc/Debug-version.md) includes a range of debugging
functionality (including an integrated debugger), and a simple HTTP
API for remote control.
