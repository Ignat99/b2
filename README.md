# b2

A cross-platform BBC Micro emulator. Use your Windows/Linux PC or
macOS computer to play your old BBC games or develop new BBC software.

Binary distributions are available for Windows and OS X: see the
[Windows installation instructions](./doc/Installing-on-Windows.md) or
[OS X installation instructions](./doc/Installing-on-OSX.md).

To build from source - your only option on Linux - follow the
[building instructions](./doc/Building.md).

There's a summary of the functionality available once up and running
in [the overview](./doc/Overview.md).

You can configure how the emulator starts up using the
[command line options](./doc/Command-Line.md).

For creating or hacking BBC software, the
[debug version](./doc/Debug-version.md) includes a range of debugging
functionality (including an integrated debugger), and a simple HTTP
API for remote control.
