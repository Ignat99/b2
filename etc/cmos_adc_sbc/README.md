ADC/SBC results from CMOS 6502s
====

Files are named as follows: <reg><ins>C<c>D<d>

`reg` is the register: `A` for accumulator, `P` for status.

`ins` is the instruction: `ADC` for ADC, `SBC` for SBC.

`c` is the carry flag value: 0 or 1.

`d` is the decimal flag value: 0 or 1.

The results here are from the 65C12 in my Master 128. (I got identical
results from a cheese wedge 2nd processor, and a
[ReCo6502Mini](http://zeridajh.org/hardware/reco6502mini/index.htm).)
