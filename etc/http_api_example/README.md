# HTTP API demo

Slightly shoddy demo of the HTTP API. You'll need Windows, 64tass
(Windows EXE supplied in repo), and curl on PATH.

To build, run emulator, then run make.bat. It will assemble the code,
reboot the emulated BBC and set the code running.

I use this with M-x compile from inside Emacs.
