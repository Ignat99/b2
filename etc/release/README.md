Release script (and bits) for the CI server.

If running locally, can test with something like this:

    etc\release\release.py testrel
	
On Windows, if running in a suitable Visual Studio command prompt, the
appropriate toolchain will be selected automatically. Otherwise,
specify on the command line, with no guarantee that the process will
complete.
